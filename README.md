System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   The DriverPass project that I developed was for the company DriverPass. The client wanted a web-based system that would allow users to review the latest policies, procedures and sample tests provided by their state's DMV in order to better train users for DMV testing. They also wanted a real-world experience for driving. This was rovided by the system's ability to allow users to book, modify, or cancel on-the-road training sessions with Driver Trainers. 
   
What did you do particularly well?
    The part that I did particularly well was keeping the technical jargon out of the presentation of the system design to the clients. This was tricky to do. I had to ensure the client that all requirements were met, but doing so in a non-technical manner, while still presenting the project as well designed. I also designed the Use Case, Sequence, and Activity Diagrams well. They were clear, concise, and met all requirements.
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    The one part of the docuuments that I would re-work on to revise would be the Business Requirement Document from project 1. I chose this document because of the notes Dr. Stefanelli gave on this part of the project. The notes were geared toward creating a good narrative with the document. I failed to create a strong narrative because of the bullet points I used instead of a flow of sentences to properly covers areas in the document. I used these notes and applied them to Project 2 in order to create that narrative.
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
     By using proper requirements gathering techniques, such as interviews, comments sheets, etc, I was able to collect the proper requirements for the system. When all requirements are properly gathered, one can get a clear picture of what the system should be from a broad perspective. Using these techniques and then applying the data collected to other portions of the system (diagrams, BRD, Gantt charts, etc) you can understand what the user needs are and ensure you are meeting those needs in your system design.
     It is crucial to meet user needs in a system design. The user is the one "using" the system regularly. Their needs must be of the utmost importance when designing a system. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
     I approach designing software from the perspective of being a detective. You must find the first clue before you can find the next. Following the clues and information given allows me to truly understand what the system should be. Sometimes find the right clues can be as simple as using proper listening techniques when interviewing users or the client. I will use many stragies that involve digging in to investigate what is being said for requirements, and what is not being said directly. Using probing and open ended questions to figure out the user's needs will be a key strategy as well.
